- First Class  
- Distinction  

**Independent Variables:**  
- School Distance  
- Residence Type  
- Family Income  
- Parental Occupation  
- Parental Education  
- Caste  
- Educational Board  
- Aid Received  
- Financial Constraints

## 🧩 Logistic Regression — Total Population  

### 🔹 Model Summary  
The multinomial logistic regression model examines how socioeconomic predictors influence the likelihood of students achieving First Class and Distinction levels relative to Second Class.

### 🔹 Key Coefficients and Interpretations  

| Predictor                     | Interpretation |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| School Distance              | Positive Exp(B > 1) — Students living closer to school are more likely to achieve higher marks due to reduced absenteeism and fatigue. |
| Income                       | Higher family income increases odds of First Class or Distinction, suggesting economic stability enhances access to resources. |
| Mother’s Education           | Strongest academic predictor — Educated mothers provide better home learning support and value education. |
| Aid Received                 | Financial aid significantly supports performance by reducing stress and providing materials. |
| Caste                        | Marginalized castes face systemic disadvantages affecting performance. |
| Missed School (Financial)    | Negative Exp(B < 1) — Financial instability lowers probability of high academic scores. |


## 🏙️ Urban Model Interpretation

### 🔹 Key Predictors and Insights

| Variable           | Effect       | Interpretation |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------|
| School Distance     | Exp(B) > 1   | Closer proximity increases academic performance; shorter commutes allow more time for study and rest. |
| Income              | Exp(B) > 1   | Economic stability enhances access to private tuition, better facilities, and technology. |
| Mother’s Education  | Exp(B) > 1   | Reflects increased parental involvement and home-based learning support. |
| Caste               | Exp(B) > 1   | Indicates persistent social stratification affecting performance. |
| Educational Board   | Exp(B) > 1   | CBSE/ICSE students perform better due to stronger academic frameworks. |
| Aid Received        | Exp(B) ≫ 1   | Students receiving financial aid demonstrate significantly improved outcomes. |

**Inference:**  
In urban areas, quality of education and parental involvement dominate. Students benefit from structured institutions, resource availability, and parental guidance, leading to higher academic achievement and overall distinction rates.


## 🌾 Rural Model Interpretation

### 🔹 Key Predictors and Insights

| Variable           | Effect       | Interpretation |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------|
| School Distance     | Exp(B) > 1   | Accessibility is the most influential factor — shorter distances drastically improve attendance and reduce dropouts. |
| Mother’s Education  | Exp(B) > 1   | A well-educated mother serves as an academic motivator, compensating for limited local resources. |
| Caste & Income      | Mixed        | Reflects disparities in social equity and economic opportunities. |
| Aid Received        | Exp(B) > 1   | Government schemes (scholarships, free meals, subsidies) strongly uplift academic achievement. |

**Inference:**  
In rural contexts, accessibility and maternal education outweigh other variables. Rural students rely heavily on peer and community support, highlighting a collaborative learning culture despite infrastructural limitations.

# 📚 Comparative Summary: Rural vs Urban Educational Factors

## 💬 Comparative Summary

| **Aspect** | **Rural Areas** | **Urban Areas** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Predictors** | School Distance, Mother’s Education | Income, Mother’s Education, Educational Board |
| **Social Influences** | Peer & Community Support | Parental Involvement |
| **Educational Resources** | Limited; community-driven | Abundant; institution-driven |
| **Effect of Aid** | High impact; bridges economic gap | Moderate; used to supplement learning |
| **Cultural Factors** | Collective learning environment | Competitive academic structure |

---

## 🧩 Model Implications

- **Educational Accessibility:** Distance remains a key determinant, emphasizing the need for more localized schools in rural regions.  
- **Maternal Education:** Empowering mothers through adult education programs can directly improve student outcomes.  
- **Policy Focus:** Scholarship expansion, school infrastructure, and resource equality can effectively reduce rural–urban disparities.  
- **Systemic Equity:** Addressing caste-based barriers and unequal resource distribution remains vital for educational parity.

## 🧠 Overall Conclusion

The study establishes that **socioeconomic status profoundly affects academic achievement**, mediated by school accessibility, parental education, income, and cultural environment.  

While **urban areas** benefit from structured parental and institutional support, **rural students** thrive on collective peer and community encouragement.  

This comparative analysis underscores the necessity for **context-specific educational policies** to ensure equal academic opportunities across geographic and socioeconomic divisions.
